                <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout my academic journey, I have honed my expertise in software development, data analysis,
                    GNSS, and GIS. My educational experience was enriched by a semester at Warsaw University of
                    Technology through the Erasmus program, where I undertook projects on Visual SLAM and Spatial
                    Analysis, further enhancing my proficiency in English. These experiences not only deepened my
                    technical knowledge but also sharpened my problem-solving abilities and teamwork skills. Through
                    various internships and projects, I successfully applied theoretical concepts to real-world
                    challenges, developing a robust ability to adapt and innovate.

                <h2>Professional Experience and Skills</h2>
                <p>
                    As I advance in my professional career, I am excited to leverage these skills and experiences to
                    contribute meaningfully to your organization and drive impactful results. My next step for my
                    professional life was my last internship, when I turned to the surveying engineering side again,
                    this time it was a company that made measurements of open mines, closed mines, power plants,
                    coupling calculations, state roads, and also made their own mapping after measurements. How it is
                    done with the data and finally how to use this data and balance the processing of the data to get
                    approval from MAPPEG at the end of the day, putting it under a standard, making the necessary
                    drawings to map the data, seeing the errors in the drawings in 3D and correcting them, switching to
                    2D again and when the errors are reduced to a minimum, the steps for mapping begin. And the last
                    step is the engineer's approval, signature stamp and maps prepared for approval sent to MAPPEG.
                    (VALID FOR MAPPEG MINE MEASUREMENTS APPROVALS)

                    I may have only mentioned the department I studied and the history related to the department, but
                    from my life and past experiences, I can see that in a place where there is no higher level of human
                    relations, the dedication given when a task has to be delivered to the deadline, in solving the
                    problems that arise while working with a team, without wasting our time and psychology. I can list
                    dozens of things that can affect both myself and the workplace we work in, such as dedication.
                    I AM NOT LOOKING FOR YOU OR YOUR BUSINESS, I AM THE PERSON YOU NEED :)
