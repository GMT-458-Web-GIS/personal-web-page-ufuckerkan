## Second
- The second page of my site, where I showed it on the map by adding a few places where I did my internship and went to the field, I did not forget to add photos.

## Third
- I left an e-mail, phone number and LinkedIn profile so that anyone who wants to reach the third and last page can reach me from somewhere.

- When the mouse cursor hovers over the contact information, it shows both the link and the contact information instantly while the mouse is on it.
