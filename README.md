# Project Content
- I briefly explained myself, my department and the things I do related to my department in the about me section.
- The second page of my site, where I showed it on the map by adding a few places where I did my internship and went to the field, I did not forget to add photos.
- I left an e-mail, phone number and LinkedIn profile so that anyone who wants to reach the third and last page can reach me from somewhere.

### Technologies Used:

- **HTML**: Structural skeleton.
- **CSS**: Design and style edits of the page.
- **JavaScript**: Interactivity and dynamic features.
- **OpenLayers**: Display of cities on the map.
- **GitHub Pages**: The platform where the project will be published.
